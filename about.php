                <article>
                    <p>I have a passion for building attractive, easy to use and robust websites.</p> 
                    <p>Over the last few years, I have taken numerous online courses and have used the skills learned to build many practise websites.
                        Some of which are online and linked to this portfolio. </p>    
                    <p>Last year I completed the Scion Coalition Scheme at Netmatters.</p>                     
                    <p>My early career was as a Analyst/Programmer at Aviva.</p>                   
                    <p>Outside of web development, I enjoy spending time with my family, photography, walking and cycling.</p>
