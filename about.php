                <article>
                    <p>I have a passion for building attractive, easy to use and robust websites.  I have done this as a hobby for a good few years and am thoroughly enjoying taking part in the Scion Coalition Scheme at Netmatters so that I can take my skills to the next level.</p>
                    <p>Outside of web development, I enjoy spending time with my family, photography, walking and cycling.</p>
